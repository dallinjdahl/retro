# Additional Tools

In addition to the core `retro` binary, the `bin` directory
will contain a few other tools.

## retro

This is the main RETRO binary.

## retro-describe

This is a program that looks up entries in the Glossary.

At the command line, you can use it like:

```
retro-describe s:for-each
```

## retro-embedimage

This is a program which generates a C file with the ngaImage
contents. It's used when building `retro`.

```
retro-embedimage ngaImage
```

The output is written to stdout; redirect it as needed.

## retro-extend

This is a program which compiles code into the ngaImage.
It's used when building `retro` and when you want to make a
standalone image with custom additions.

Example command line:

```
retro-extend ngaImage example/rot13.forth
```

Pass the image name as the first argument, and then file names
as susequent ones. Do *not* use this for things relying on I/O
apart from the basic console output as it doesn't emulate other
devices. If you need to load in things that rely on using the
optional I/O devices, see the **Advanced Builds** chapter.

## retro-muri

This is the assembler for Nga. It's used to build the initial
RETRO kernel and can be used by other tools as well.

## retro-tags

TBD

## retro-unu

This is the literate source extraction tool for RETRO. It
is used in building `retro`.

Example usage:

```
retro-unu literate/RetroForth.md
```

Output is written to stdout; redirect as neeeded.
