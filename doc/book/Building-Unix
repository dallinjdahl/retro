# Building RETRO on BSD, Linux, macOS

RETRO is well supported on BSD (FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD),
Linux, and macOS systems. It should build on any of these
without issue.

## Requirements

- c compiler & linker
- standard headers
- make

## Process

Run `make`

This will build the toolchain and then the main `retro`
executable.

## Executables

In the `bin/` directory:

    retro
    retro-unu
    retro-muri
    retro-extend
    retro-embedimage
    retro-describe

## Issues

If you run into any build issues, please send details to
crc@forth.works so I can work on addressing them as quickly
as possible.
