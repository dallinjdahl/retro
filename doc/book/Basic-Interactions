# Basic Interactions

Start RETRO in interactive mode:

```
retro -i
```

You should see something similar to this:

    RETRO 12 (rx-2019.6)
    8388608 MAX, TIB @ 1025, Heap @ 9374

At this point you are at the *listener*, which reads and
processes your input. You are now set to begin exploring
RETRO.

To exit, run `bye`:

```
bye
```
